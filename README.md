## 💡 Usage Tips

*   **Be Specific**: Mention the *Client*, *Task*, and *Outcome* in your activity.

    *   **Specific Target**: Click "Target Competency" button and fill in the template.
    *   *Example*: `COMPETENCY: 1a EVIDENCE: I reconciled the bank statement...` (This guarantees ONLY competency 1a is returned).
